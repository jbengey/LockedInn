<p align="center"> Locked Inn is a VR pub experience created to allow individuals to feel immersed in a pub environment, as covid-19 restrictions (lock down) don't allow them to do so in person.</p>

## Website
This project has an official webpage which contains more of an overview of the pub itself alongside screenshots and gameplay.
